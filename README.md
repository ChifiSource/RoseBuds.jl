[**toolips.js**](https://github.com/ChifiSource/toolips.js) is built on a functionally programmed reactive observable library that evaluates via JavaScript expressions. The code is parsed into meta-data using [JSExpr.jl](), along with [JSExpr.js](). This module acts as a compatibility library by creating Julia-equivalent types, which can then be parsed into Java Script expressions. These expressions are then compiled into regular JavaScript code then added to the list of dynamic observable scripts.
## Multi-Paradigm
One great thing about toolips is that it follows the " functional core, imperative API" philosophy. The core [**toolips.js**](https://github.com/ChifiSource/toolips.js) is merely a reactive declarative library for JavaScript, however the high-level bindings for Julia make the code incredibly easy to program. The syntax in Julia mirrors that of JavaScript perfectly, the calls are identical, and the transfer between languages is relatively high-speed and simple. Interpolation between the languages is made much easier thanks to the JSExpr.jl library
## Inclusive
[**toolips.js**](https://github.com/ChifiSource/toolips.js) is a reactive front-end library, however **Toolips.jl** is a fully-featured server and web-development frame-work for Julia. That being said, the framework can do anything from front-end to back-end, and all with the speed and power of Julia.
