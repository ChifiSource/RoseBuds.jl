**Toolips.jl** is a multi-paradigm web-development framework built around function calls and [HTTP.jl](https://github.com/JuliaWeb/HTTP.jl). This is Julia's first true **full-stack** web-development framework, and it is likely that by a stable release you will be able to do just about anything you may elsewhere with Toolips.jl. **Here are some of the features that the framework includes:**
- Extendable servers.
- Extendable components.
- A library of servables.
- A high-level routing interface.
- A simple library of request methods.
- Dynamic Routing.

 Currently, there is no documentation really put together for Toolips.jl. The package is still relatively new, and I am still trying to get a decent enough candadite for release, although I am most definitely getting close! If you would like to learn how to use the package without the docs, I would suggest referencing this sample application:
