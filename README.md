**Toolips.jl** is a multi-paradigm web-server created to work as a solid back-end to serve simple front-ends. I have a lot of plans for this project, and am going to be working on several projects of my own alongside this project in order to ensure that everything is up to snuff. Thank you guys for your interest in the package. Honestly, development is going well, and I hope that soon the potential of such a package can be seen! There is high potential I might even end up creating a slight binding, not with any reactive DOM sorts of things I do not think though. For now the focus is primarily on getting secure output and some levels of input via request arguments and these sorts of things. There are obviously security issues with that, but with this design I am confident it will likely turn into something worth checking out!
