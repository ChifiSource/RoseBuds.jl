**Toolips.jl** is a multi-paradigm web-development framework built around function calls and [HTTP.jl](https://github.com/JuliaWeb/HTTP.jl). While the servers and routes are object-oriented, the core methodology is centralized around function pipelines. In addition, Toolips.jl is a full-stack framework that is meant to bring together all your code and centralize it around Julia. While other solutions might have you write Javascript, using Toolips.jl there is often no need. In scenarios when you do, though Toolips allows for much different types of interactions with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The package features
- A front-end templating engine.
- Interact-able forms with push data.
- Automatically generated function pipelines on routes.
- Organized and simple file-structure
- Asynchronicity
- Server management
- Speed compared to other options
What is great about Toolips.jl is that it can apply to a multitude of different projects. If you would like to take a look at the kind of things that are possible using this module, then I highly suggest you check out [ToolipsApp.jl](http://github.com/emmettgb/ToolipsApp.jl), which is a collection of projects that utilize Toolips.jl.
